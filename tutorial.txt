First, Take the code and either use the bookmark or console. For console, Make sure you dont paste it when lesson is loading or in lesson, only 
where you can view lessons or choosing a subject. It is the same for bookmark. Once you have made a bookmark with it, just click it either inside of the subject choosing
or where you can view your lesson path.
